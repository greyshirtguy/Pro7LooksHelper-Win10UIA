# Pro7LooksHelper-Win10UIA
A tiny Win10 App to quickly Set Looks in Pro7.

It is a separate app that "talks" to Pro7 through Windows UI automation and allows you to set the active look.
Unlike it's MacOS brother https://github.com/greyshirtguy/Pro7LooksHelper-AppleScript it does not auto-update to reflect when active look is changed in Pro7...
....Unless you have the edit "Looks" window open!

You can open the edit "Looks" window and just minimise it - but, be careful to un-minimise it manually by clicking on the Pro7 icon in taskbar and re-selecting it!


It has been made with same background color as Pro7 toolbar - so you position the app on top of Pro7 and make it look "native"!

To move the window, click and drag the "Lorax/Looks" icon!
