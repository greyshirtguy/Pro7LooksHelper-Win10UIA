# Pro7LooksHelper-Win10UIA
A tiny Win10 App to quickly Set Looks in Pro7.

Pro7LooksHelper is a utility application that "talks" to Pro7 through Windows UI automation and allows you to quickly set the active look.

Please note that, unlike it's [MacOS brother](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/Pro7LooksHelper-AppleScript), it does not auto-update itself to reflect when active look is changed in Pro7...Unless you have the edit "Looks" window open!  If you want it to always reflect the active look then you need to have the edit "Looks" window always open.

If you don't want to have the edit "Looks" window open, you can still set looks with this app - but it will not update to follow Pro7 when looks are changed within Pro7.

One workaround is to open the edit "Looks" window and just minimise it. This will work fine. However, be careful to **always restore the looks window manually** by clicking on the Pro7 icon in taskbar and re-selecting it!  If you try to open the edit "Looks" window using the Pro7 menu "Edit Looks" (or keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-1) while it is minimised it will NOT show!  It will remain minimised. You must click the Pro7 icon in the taskbar and click on it to "restore" it.

To move the window, click and drag on the Looks (Lorax) icon. To close, right-click the app icon in taskbar.

You can download a prebuilt application in [releases](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/Pro7LooksHelper-Win10UIA/releases)

It has been made with same background color as Pro7 toolbar - so you can optionally position the app on top of Pro7 and make it look "at home" on the Pro7 toolbar.
